# MIT600 Introduction to computer science and programming - Python

as taught in Fall 2008.

My in-class notes, exercises and problem set solutions for the great MIT600 course.

This online course has been teaching me how to think in the language of computers, not just the usual syntax and data structure teaching found in most other online programming tutorials.
